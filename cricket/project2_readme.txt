as a kid i am sure that at least once you have played Odd-Eve aka known as hand cricket.
this is a game likes rock-paper-scissors 
in this game both player select tails or head before playing 
accordingly coin won player can select batting or balling,
now game actually starts.

now both players keep showing random numbers till both gets the same numbers.
if both players gets same numbers the player who chose batting gets out and turn switch.
if both has different number the player who choose batting gets the points which he/she has shown


lets understand it with example:
"""	
	p1 - odd
	p2 - even
	
	p1 - 2
	p2 - 3
	total: 2+3 = 5 odd
	
	p2 - won
	
	p2 - balling
	p1 - batting
	
	p2 - 2
	p1 - 1
	p2_score : 2
	
	p2 - 3
	p1 - 4
	p2_score : 2+3 : 5
	
	p2 - 4
	p1 - 4
	p2 out, final score of p2 : 5
	
	now p1 gets the batting
	
	p1 - 2
	p2 - 1
	p1_score : 2
	
	p1 - 1
	p2 - 1
	p1 out, final score of p1 : 1
	
	p1_score: 1
	p2_score: 5
	
	p2 won
"""	
i have created virtual simulation of that game.
in this code you get chance of selecting 0/1 head/tails.
then computer will select head/tails randomly.
after that it will show choice of computer and result
if you won you will get chance of selecting batting/balling
and after you selection computer will switch accordingly in batting/balling.

if you lose
computer will select randomly and after completing it will switch automatically.

after the completion it will show score of user and computer with results.
